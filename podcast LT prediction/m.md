my firist project in data science and machine learning
-Applying the knowlage obtained from theoretical courses 
- Doing EDA to get primative insights give me general understanding of data 
   -do some statical analysis for numerical data like (filling null,removing outliers, doing some visualization,..)
-Data preprocessing stage to prepare data for the model encoding process for Categorical columns
-applying tree Based model due to the majority of Categorical columns 
   - using random forest algorithm as A regressor
   - model hyper tuning parameters to deal with bias and variance trade offs
    - model Evaluation by 
            Training RMSE: 7.0248
            Validation RMSE: 11.8294
             MAE: 8.71 minutes
